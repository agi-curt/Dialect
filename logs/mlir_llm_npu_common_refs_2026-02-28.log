Task: From previously collected papers, find common references and add any that also implement MLIR dialects for local/on-device LLM execution.

Seed set considered (validated):
- Hexagon-MLIR: Leveraging Collective Hardware and Algorithm Co-design for Efficient LLM Deployment on Mobile NPUs (arXiv:2602.19762)
- Analyzing Latency Hiding and Parallelism in an MLIR-based AI Kernel Compiler (arXiv:2602.20204)
- From Loop Nests to Silicon: Mapping AI Workloads onto AMD NPUs with MLIR-AIR (arXiv:2510.14871)
- Efficiency, Expressivity, and Extensibility in a Close-to-Metal NPU Programming Interface (arXiv:2504.18430 / IEEE FCCM 2025)
- ARIES: Agile MLIR-Based Compilation Flow for Reconfigurable Devices with AI Engines (ACM FPGA 2025)

Sources used in this pass:
- Google/Scholar result pages captured via web search tool (title/related-paper expansions)
- arXiv records for validated seed papers
- ACM/IEEE metadata pages already collected in previous logs

Common-reference candidates observed repeatedly in related/reference expansions:
1) MLIR-AIE: an MLIR-based framework for AI Engine architectures
2) AIR for GPU and NPU workloads on RDNAs and AI Engines
3) Exploiting Dynamicity in Matrix Multiplication with the AMD AI Engine MLIR Framework
4) Efficiency, Expressivity, and Extensibility in a Close-to-Metal NPU Programming Interface

Filter applied for adding papers:
- Must implement/use an MLIR dialect or MLIR-based compiler layer
- Must target LLM (or explicit LLM kernels like attention) 
- Must be for local/on-device NPU execution (Qualcomm/AMD context)

Screening outcomes:
- MLIR-AIE framework paper: MLIR=yes, on-device NPU=yes, LLM=not explicit -> NOT added
- AIR for GPU/NPU paper: MLIR=yes, on-device NPU=yes, LLM=not explicit -> NOT added
- Exploiting Dynamicity in MatMul paper: MLIR=yes, on-device NPU=yes, LLM=not explicit -> NOT added
- Close-to-Metal NPU Programming Interface: MLIR=yes, on-device NPU=yes, LLM=not explicit (general kernels) -> NOT newly added under strict LLM filter

Addition under strict filter:
- No new paper beyond previously listed items passed all three conditions in this pass.

Notes/limitations:
- Environment-level access constraints prevented full-text reference scraping from every source paper in this run; overlap identification used available indexed metadata and related/reference expansions.
- Area remains recent (2025-2026), with many preprints/workshops and sparse citation signals.
