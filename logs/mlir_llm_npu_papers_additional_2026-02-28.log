Task: Find additional papers beyond prior shortlist on MLIR dialect/compiler work for Qualcomm and AMD NPUs, prioritizing conference papers and citation signals.

Sources used in this pass:
- arXiv
- ACM (via DOI/dblp metadata)
- IEEE (via DOI/dblp metadata)
- Google Scholar (availability checks via source cross-links; direct citation counts available only for ARIES from prior pass)

Important corrections/notes:
- Previous pass had one mistaken arXiv ID mapping from noisy search results. This pass re-validated each added paper directly by title/abstract pages.
- This area is very recent (2025-2026), so citation counts are sparse/unavailable for many items.

Search trail highlights:
- Direct arXiv validation:
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19762
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20204
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14871

- IEEE conference metadata for IRON paper:
  - https://dblp.org/rec/conf/fccm/HunhoffMDBBNFLV25
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM62733.2025.00043

  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3706628.3708854

Additional papers found (beyond previous shortlist):
1) Analyzing Latency Hiding and Parallelism in an MLIR-based AI Kernel Compiler
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20204
   - Status: Accepted at MLBench workshop as part of ASPLOS 2026 (per arXiv comments)
   - Relevance: Qualcomm-associated MLIR compiler pipeline analysis (Vec/MT/DB), NPU-targeted AI kernels.

2) From Loop Nests to Silicon: Mapping AI Workloads onto AMD NPUs with MLIR-AIR
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14871
   - Status: Preprint (2025); referenced as citation target by MLIR-AIR docs
   - Relevance: Introduces AIR dialect; includes multi-head attention from LLaMA 2 mapped to AMD NPU.

3) Efficiency, Expressivity, and Extensibility in a Close-to-Metal NPU Programming Interface
   - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18430
   - IEEE FCCM 2025: https://dblp.org/rec/conf/fccm/HunhoffMDBBNFLV25
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM62733.2025.00043
   - Relevance: IRON/MLIR-AIE stack for AMD Ryzen AI NPU programming (close-to-metal API/compiler flow).

4) (Adjacent, ACM workshop) Programmer productivity and performance on AMD’s AI Engines: Offloading Fortran intrinsics via MLIR a case-study
   - ACM workshop metadata: https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/programmer-productivity-and-performance-on-amds-ai-engines-offloa/
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3731599.3767414
   - Relevance: Explicitly lowers MLIR linear algebra dialect to AMD AIE dialects; not LLM-specific.

5) (Adjacent, ACM FPGA 2025) Seamless Acceleration of Fortran Intrinsics via AMD AI Engines
   - Metadata: https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/seamless-acceleration-of-fortran-intrinsics-via-amd-ai-engines
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3706628.3708854
   - Relevance: AMD AI Engines compiler path; useful adjacent compiler evidence, not LLM-specific.

Citation signal notes:
- Prior verified Scholar signal remains:
  - ARIES (ACM FPGA 2025) showed "Cited by 2" during prior pass.
- For newly added 2025-2026 papers, direct Scholar counts were not consistently exposed in accessible pages during this run.

Conclusion:
- Most new, direct Qualcomm/AMD NPU + MLIR + LLM papers are very recent preprints/workshop papers.
- Strong conference-backed additions are currently concentrated on AMD NPU tooling (IEEE FCCM, ACM workshop tracks), while direct Qualcomm LLM+MLIR work is currently arXiv/workshop-heavy.
